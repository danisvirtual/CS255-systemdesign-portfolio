# CS-255: System Analysis and Design  
### Southern New Hampshire University

## Overview
This repository contains my work for **CS-255 System Analysis and Design**.  
It includes two major projects completed during the course, which demonstrate my ability to gather user requirements, design system solutions, and communicate technical concepts clearly through documentation and UML diagrams.

## Project Artifacts

### **Project One â€“ Business Requirements Document (BRD)**
The Business Requirements Document defines the main goals and functions of the DriverPass system, based on client interviews and user needs. It outlines how the system should support scheduling lessons, managing users, and providing online driving test preparation.

**File:** `CS 255 Business Requirements Document.docx`

---

### **Project Two â€“ System Design Document**
The System Design Document builds on the requirements from Project One and provides detailed UML diagrams, technical requirements, and system design decisions for DriverPass.  
It covers use case, activity, sequence, and class diagrams as well as system security and performance considerations.

## Reflection

### **1. Summary of the DriverPass Project**
DriverPass was a system created for a driving school that needed an online platform to help students prepare for their driving tests.  
The system allows students to schedule driving lessons, take online practice tests, and track their progress, while instructors and administrators manage schedules and performance.

---

### **2. What I Did Well**
I did especially well organizing the system requirements and turning them into clear, accurate UML diagrams.  
These diagrams made it easy to visualize how students, instructors, and administrators would interact with the system.

---

### **3. What I Would Improve**
If I could revise one part of my work, I would expand the sequence diagram to include more details about how data flows between the web interface and the database.  
This would make the design even clearer and help guide the development process more effectively.

---

### **4. Interpreting and Applying User Needs**
I designed every feature around the userâ€™s goals. For example, making it simple for students to schedule lessons and get quick feedback from practice tests.  
Understanding and prioritizing user needs is critical to ensuring that the final product is intuitive, reliable, and actually solves the clientâ€™s problem.

---

### **5. My Approach to Designing Software**
My approach is methodical and user-centered. I start with requirement gathering, move into modeling and diagramming workflows, and refine the design before implementation.  
This approach ensures accuracy, minimizes rework, and produces a solution that aligns with both technical feasibility and user expectations.
